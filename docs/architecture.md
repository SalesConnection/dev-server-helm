# Dev Server Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the Dev Server Helm chart and the resources it creates.

## Overview

The Dev Server Helm chart deploys containerized development environments on Kubernetes. It's designed to provide isolated environments for developers with dedicated resources, persistent storage, and SSH access.

## Component Architecture

### Key Components

1. **User Deployments**: Individual deployments for each user
2. **Persistent Storage**: EBS volumes for user data
3. **Network Services**: Services exposing SSH and HTTP endpoints
4. **Authentication**: SSH public key authentication
5. **Resource Management**: Kubernetes resource quotas and limits

## Resource Creation

For each user defined in the values.yaml file, the chart creates:

### 1. Deployment

- Runs the development server container
- Includes init container for SSH setup
- Mounts persistent storage and configuration
- Applies resource limits and requests

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: devserver-username
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: devserver
          image: devserver-image:tag
          ports:
            - containerPort: 22  # SSH
            - containerPort: 80  # HTTP
```

### 2. Service

- Exposes SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80) endpoints
- Enables network access to the development environment

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: devserver-username
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      name: http
    - port: 22
      targetPort: 22
      name: ssh
```

### 3. PersistentVolumeClaim

- Provides persistent storage for user data
- Uses AWS EBS volumes (gp2 storage class)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: username-ebs
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: gp2
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 30Gi
```

### 4. ConfigMap

- Stores user's public SSH key for authentication

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: username-public-key
data:
  authorized_keys: "ssh-rsa AAAA..."
```

## Topology Spread

The chart implements topology spread constraints to ensure high availability:

```yaml
topologySpreadConstraints:
  - maxSkew: 2  # Configurable via values
    topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
    whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
    labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        service: devserver
```

This ensures that pods with the label `service: devserver` are distributed across nodes with a maximum skew defined in the values.

## Authentication Flow

1. User's public key is stored in a ConfigMap
2. Init container copies the public key to the authorized_keys file
3. SSH daemon authenticates users based on their public key
4. No password authentication is allowed

## Network Flow

1. External traffic â†’ Kubernetes Service
2. Service routes to the appropriate pod based on selectors
3. Pod exposes SSH (22) and HTTP (80) ports
4. Internal container processes handle the connections

## Resource Management

- CPU and memory limits are configurable
- Storage size is configurable per user
- Topology spread ensures balanced distribution

## Security Considerations

- SSH access is secured with public key authentication
- Each user has an isolated environment
- Service account permissions are limited to required operations
- No root access to the host system

## Scaling Considerations

- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler can be enabled
- Resource limits prevent overutilization
- Topology spread ensures balanced load across nodes

## AWS Integration

- Uses EBS volumes for persistent storage
- Integrates with ECR for container images
- Uses IAM roles for service accounts for AWS API access
